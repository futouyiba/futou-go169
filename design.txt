5 types of status of a board position:
1. previous black stone -- 1
2. previous white stone -- 2
3. no stone -- 0
4. a black stone that was just been put -- 6
5. a white stone that was just been put -- 7

The data relationship between a stone and a stone chain. Choices are:
1. ancestor relation. Since chain merges and eliminates are quite often, this may not be a good idea.
2. foreign key. Does GAE have foreign key logic?
3. multi-multi? Not necessary since it's a 1-multi.
